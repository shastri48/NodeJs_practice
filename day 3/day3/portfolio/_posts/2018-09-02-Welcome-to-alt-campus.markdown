Start your journey of Web development from scratch using jekyll.  
For this you need to learn few basic things as mentioned below...
{% highlight ruby %}
1. Ruby installed on your computer
      sudo apt-get install ruby
2. Install jekyll
      sudo apt-get install jekyll
3. Install Bundler
      sudo apt-get install bundler
{% endhighlight %}
Sometimes we may face difficulties in installing the above things.  
If you face [nakogiri][nakogiri] problem then use following command  
      -sudo apt-get install build-essential  
      -sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev  
      -sudo gem install nakogiri  
      -bundle install
